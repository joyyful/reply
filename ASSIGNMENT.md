# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> To learn to use the library, I first went to its nmpjs webpage to learn about the basics. There, I learned about the features of the library such as verifying the "type" of user responses, validating and checking responses, and setting field default values. I also looked over an example code that outlined the usage of the module, which actually was one of the most helpful resources for this library. Then from there, as advised by the assignment specs, I went to the README.md file to read what the developer had to say about his code. I was able to read through the examples he came up with which give me a better understanding of the library's functionalities. Then, finally, I started looking over the index.js file. Something that made the module's code easy to understand was how clean and simple the code was. The syntax and styling of the code was very concise, so even as I was glancing through it for the first time, I was able to get the gist of the program. Additionally, functions were named appropriately and gave the reader context about what operations it supported. On the flip side, because of the minimalistic nature of the code (a lot of code seemed to be written in "shorthand"), I found myself unfamiliar with some of the language. One change that would have made it easier for novice programmers to ready the code is writing it in a more typically "longhand" syntax. I also think that if the variable names were more consistent, it would have been easier to understand as well.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Raising the level of abstraction means telling the user what the element does without telling them exactly how it works. I always think of the example of a radio. You can comment by saying this radio can navigate to the various radio stations and output their audio feed, but you would never comment and say how the radio works mechanically or how it was specifically built. A good "abstracted" comment would be able to explain to a non-programmer what tasks or functionalities the code is responsible for without getting into too much detail on the specifics. If I were to explain to a new CSE142 student how to write an effective comment, I would say to be concise and to-the-point. Explain only what you need to explain and leave anything unncessary out. While it's important to clearly explain the code, it's also important not to overwhelm the reader with text, especially if the comment is redundant to the code itself.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me about 6 hours in total - 1 hour to look over the code and examples, 2.5 hours to comment, 2 hour to write examples, and 0.5 hours to complete this file


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I'm still kind of stuck on how to automatically produce the HTML files of the documentation. I tried many times but nothing seems to be added to my "doc" folder... I have followed all of the directions on the homework spec but no luck.
